## 🔄 Future Enhancements


## 🔁 How the App Handles Changes

- **Persistent data:** The app uses AsyncStorage together with the Zustand persistence middleware to store draws, streaks, and journal entries locally. User progress is preserved across restarts and app updates.
- **Versioned state & migrations:** Stored state includes a version key so the app can run lightweight migrations on startup to adapt older state shapes (e.g., recalculating streaks or renaming fields) and avoid data loss when the schema changes.
- **Asset updates:** Card images are bundled in the `assets/cards` folder and referenced via the image mapping in `src/data/cardImages.ts`. When illustrations are updated, updating the mapping keeps existing saved draws referencing the correct assets.
- **Daily-draw & timezone handling:** The "last draw" is tracked as a date (UTC/ISO). The app compares stored dates to the current date to keep streak logic consistent across timezone or clock changes.
- **Offline-first & sync considerations:** Progress is written locally immediately. If cloud sync is added later, local changes should merge by timestamp to resolve conflicts and preserve the most recent user actions.
- **Backups & export (recommended):** For long-term preservation, provide export or backup options (or rely on device backups) so users can keep their history when moving devices or reinstalling the app.

- **Security note:** Do not commit secrets or `.env.local` files. If sensitive keys are accidentally committed, rotate/revoke them immediately and remove the file from the repository history. See `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidance and use `.env.example` as a template.
